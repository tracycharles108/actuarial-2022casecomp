Bruin Actuarial Society’s Tenth Case Competition (2022)

Bruin Actuarial Society, or BAS, is UCLA’s premier organization for student actuaries. See their website here: https://www.math.ucla.edu/~actuary/

The 2022 Case Competition prompt was a reserving analysis task and a presentation on CAT reserving, written by Liberty Mutual. 

Our team, Team 11, consisted of 4 then-sophomores: June Tsay, Minju Kim, Shannon Leo, Tracy Charles.

We prepared a presentation, a reserving analysis workbook, and a written executive summary. In the first round, we did a live presentation in front of BAS officers, then did the same in front of actuarial professionals in the final round.

We completed the task using Microsoft Excel and VBA for automation and data visualization. In support of our methods, we referenced a document by the Casualty Actuarial Society found here: https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/database/studynotes_friedland_estimating.pdf
